# Learning Web Scraping with Python

This is as a place to document my python web scraping practice files and questions/resources that come up as I go. The goal will largely be to scrape deep statistics on European soccer players.

Resources:

- [Beautiful Soup Article](https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/#step-1-inspect-your-data-source)
- [Soccerdata Webscraper API](https://soccerdata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/fbref.html#soccerdata.FBref.read_player_season_stats)
- [Reservoir NFT Sales API](https://reservoir.tools/)


Progress:
- Learned the basic elements of most web pages in HTML.
- Learned how to fetch and parse JSON objects using BeautifulSoup.
- Learned how to use the Reservoir NFT API to scrape and process large sales time series'.
- Experimented with the soccerdata API for an ongoing player valuation economics model.
